# MPF-1B-Loader
Load your Z80-MPF-1B board from your W10 computer

During the Retrochallenge RC2019/09 I want  to make a good workflow for programming and uploading your Z80-assembly program from your W10 PC to the Micro Professor 1B Z80 singel board computer. Also I have a Russian Z80-clone which i would use for working with the MPF-1B

The blog of this story would be told on: https://avretro.wordpress.com/

Retrochallenge RC2019/09: http://www.retrochallenge.org/

On this GitHub i want to store all the information and programs to build the interface and to program the Loader by yourself. Also the final build Loader program comes here.
